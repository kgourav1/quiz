    "question": "Let the time taken to switch between user and kernel modes of execution be t1 while the time taken to switch between two processes be t2. Which of the following is TRUE?",
    "choice1": "t1 > t2",
    "choice2": "t1 = t2",
    "choice3": "t1 < t2",
    "choice4": "Nothing can be said about the relation between t1 and t2",
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Correct answer is (C). Process switching involves mode switch, which typically takes more time compared to switching between user and kernel modes."

    "question": "A system uses FIFO policy for page replacement. It has 4 page frames with no pages loaded to begin with. The system first accesses 100 distinct pages in some order and then accesses the same 100 pages but now in the reverse order. How many page faults will occur?",
    "choice1": "196",
    "choice2": "192",
    "choice3": "197",
    "choice4": "195",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Correct answer is (A). The first 4 accesses will not cause page faults, but all subsequent accesses will cause page faults, resulting in a total of 100 + 96 = 196 page faults."

    "question": "Which of the following statements are true?",
    "choice1": "I only",
    "choice2": "I and III only",
    "choice3": "II and III only",
    "choice4": "I, II and III",
    "answer": 4,
    "explanation": "Correct answer is (D). Each statement is individually true: I. Shortest remaining time first scheduling may cause starvation. II. Preemptive scheduling may cause starvation. III. Round robin is better than FCFS in terms of response time."

  {
    "question": "Consider the methods used by processes P1 and P2 for accessing their critical sections whenever needed. Which one of the following statements describes the properties achieved?",
    "choice1": "Mutual exclusion but not progress",
    "choice2": "Progress but not mutual exclusion",
    "choice3": "Neither mutual exclusion nor progress",
    "choice4": "Both mutual exclusion and progress",
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Correct answer is (A). The methods ensure mutual exclusion as only one process can enter the critical section at a time. However, progress is not guaranteed because a process waiting to enter its critical section might be indefinitely delayed."
